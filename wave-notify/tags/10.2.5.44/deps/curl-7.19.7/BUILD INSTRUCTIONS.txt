Building CURL
=============

Requirements
------------

OpenSSL:

Get an OpenSSL version that has been compiled with the VC6 compiler or has
been statically compiled. A read-made has been included in the deps folder.
If a new one is required, the headers can be retrieved from
http://www.openssl.org/source/.

The expected layout of the folders is as follows:

  .\inc32: Include files;
  .\out32dll: Lib and DLL files.

Set the correct environment variable with:

  set OPENSSL_PATH=c:\<build path>\openssl-<version>

zlib:

The compiled version for zlib can be retrieved from http://www.zlib.net/. This
file contains all headers and binaries.

The expected layout of the folders is as follows:

  .: All files including the headers, lib and DLL.

Set the correct environment variable with:

  set ZLIB_PATH=C:\<build path>\zlib-<version>

cURL:

Get the latest version of the sources for cURL from http://curl.haxx.se/ and
extract this into the build path.

Set the correct target with:

  set CFG=release-dll-ssl-dll-zlib-dll

Modifications to the makefile
-----------------------------

To get the PDB file, the following modifications to the makefile have to be
made to c:\<build path>\curl-<version>\lib\Makefile.vc6.

Add these lines around the following section (or at least below the definitions
of the modified variables):

  ##############################################################
  # Runtime library configuration

The following lines must be added:

  CLFAGS = $(CFLAGS) /Zi
  LNKDLL = $(LNKDLL) /DEBUG
  LNKLIB = $(LNKLIB) /DEBUG

Building
--------

The library must be build with the VC6 compiler and should be build with
the Windows 2000 build environment from the Windows 2003 R2 Platform SDK.

Start the build environment with the provided shortcut to the
Windows 2000 Retail x86 environment.

Build the library using the following command from the folder
C:\<build path>\curl-<version>\lib:

  nmake -f Makefile.vc6 all

The folder release-dll-ssl-dll-zlib-dll should now contain a workling DLL.
